  - question: What agency immediately preceded the MBTA?
    answer: |
      The MBTA was immediately preceded by an agency known as the Metropolian Transit Authority, or MTA,
      which was formed in 1947. The MTA purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar,
      and bus operations from the Boston Elevated Railway.
  - question: When did the Boston Elevated Railway start replacing rail vehicles with buses?
    answer: |
      The Boston Elevated Railway started replacing rail vehicles with buses in 1922,
      a process later dubbed "bustitution". The last Middlesex and Boston Street Railway streetcars
      ran in 1930. The BERy started replacing some rail vehicles with trackless trolleys in 1936.
  - question: What happened to the Pleasant Street Portal?
    answer: |
      The last two streetcar lines running into the Pleasant Street Portal of the Tremont Street
      subway were replaced with buses in 1953 and 1962, and the portal has since been covered over
      by a public park.
  - question: What portions of the MBTA system are still elevated railways?
    answer: |
      With the 2004 replacement of the Causeway Street Elevated by a subway tunnel connection,
      the only remaining elevated railways are a short portion of the Red Line at Charles/MGH,
      and a short portion of the Green Line between Science Park and Lechmere.
  - question: When was the Charlestown Elevated replaced?
    answer: |
      The Charlestown Elevated, part of the Orange Line north of downtown Boston, was replaced by
      the Haymarket North Extension in 1975.
