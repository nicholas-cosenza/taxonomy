      The third molar, commonly called wisdom tooth, is the most posterior of the three molars in each quadrant
      of the human dentition.
    question: What is a wisdom tooth?
  - answer: |
      Most adults have four wisdom teeth, one in each of the four quadrants, but it is possible to have none, fewer,
      or more, in which case the extras are called supernumerary teeth.
    question: How many wisdom teeth humans have?
  - answer: |
      Wisdom teeth may become stuck (impacted) against other teeth if there is not enough space for them to come through
      normally. Impacted wisdom teeth are still sometimes removed for orthodontic treatment, believing that they move
      the other teeth and cause crowding, though this is not held anymore as true.
    question: What issues can wisdom teeth have?
  - answer: |
      Maxillary (upper) third molars commonly have a triangular crown with a deep central fossa from which multiple
      irregular fissures originate. Their roots are commonly fused together and can be irregular in shape.
      Mandibular (lower) third molars are the smallest molar teeth in the permanent dentition. The crown usually
      takes on a rounded rectangular shape that features four or five cusps with an irregular fissure pattern.
      Roots are greatly reduced in size and can be fused together.
    question: What is morphology of wisdom teeth?
  - answer: |
      Anthropologists believe wisdom teeth, or the third set of molars, serve to help chew food in the adult, in humans
      and in apes and monkeys, who all have wisdom teeth too, in their diet of harder to chew food â€“ like fresh fruit,
      leaves, roots, nuts and meats.
    question: What is the function of wisdom teeth?
  - answer: |
      Although formally known as third molars,
      the common name is wisdom teeth because they
      appear so late - much later than the other teeth,
      at an age where people are presumably 'wiser' than
      as a child, when the other teeth erupt.
    question: Where did the term wisdom tooth come from?
  - answer: |
      The oldest known impacted wisdom tooth belonged to a
      European woman who lived between 13,000 and 11,000 BCE,
      in the Magdalenian period.
    question: When was the first documented example of an impacted wisdom tooth?
  - answer: |
      Anthropologists believe wisdom teeth, or the third set
      of molars, serve to help chew food in the adult, in humans
      and in apes and monkeys, who all have wisdom teeth too,
      in their diet of harder to chew food - like fresh fruit,
      leaves, roots, nuts and meats.
    question: What is the function of the wisdom tooth?
  - answer: |
      Practice and maintenance of good oral hygiene can help
      prevent and control some wisdom tooth pathologies.
      In addition to twice daily toothbrushing, interdental
      cleaning is recommended to ensure plaque build doesn't
      occur in interdental areas. There are various products
      available for this - dental floss and interdental brushes
      being the most common.
    question: How does one care of their wisdom teeth?
  - answer: |
      Wisdom teeth may become stuck (impacted) against other teeth
      if there is not enough space for them to come through normally.
    question: What is one of the more common issues that can occur with wisdom teeth?
