    question: What is the origin of the word 'lapis lazuli'?
  - answer: |
      Mines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis lazuli. Important amounts are also
      produced from mines west of Lake Baikal in Russia, and in the Andes mountains in Chile which is the source that
      the Inca used to carve artifacts and jewelry. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia, the
      United States, and Canada
    question: Where is lapis lazuli sourced from?
  - answer: |
      The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%), a blue feldspathoid
      silicate mineral of the sodalite family, with the formula (Na,Ca)8(AlSiO 4) 6(S,SO 4,Cl) 1–2. Most lapis lazuli
      also contains calcite (white), and pyrite (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain augite,
      diopside, enstatite, mica, hauynite, hornblende, nosean, and sulfur-rich löllingite geyerite.
    question: What is the composition of lapis lazuli?
  - answer: |
      Lapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewellery,carvings, boxes, mosaics, ornaments, small
      statues, and vases. Interior items and finishing buildings can be also made with lapis. Two of the columns
      framing the iconostasis in Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg are built with lapis. During the
      Renaissance, lapis was ground and processed to make the pigment ultramarine for use in frescoes and oil
      painting. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically
      identical synthetic variety became available.
