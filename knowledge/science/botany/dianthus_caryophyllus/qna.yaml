    The leaves are glaucous greyish green to blue-green, slender, up to 15 cm (6 in) long.
    The flowers are produced singly or up to five together in a cyme;
    they are around 3–5 cm (1 1/4 in - 2 in) in diameter, and sweetly scented;
    the original natural flower color is bright pinkish-purple, but cultivars of other colors,
    including red, pink, yellow, white, and green have been developed.
    While sometimes dyed blue for cut bouquets, there are no known carnation
    cultivars that produce a true blue flower.
    The fragrant, hermaphrodite flowers have a radial symmetry.
    The four to six surrounding the calyx, egg-shaped, sting-pointed scales leaves
    are only ¼ as long as the calyx tube."
