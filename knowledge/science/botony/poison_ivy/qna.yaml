  - question: What is poison ivy?
    answer: |
      Poison ivy is a plant species in the genus Toxicodendron native to North America. It contains urushiol, a
      clear liquid compound found within the sap of the plant that causes an itching rash in most people who touch it.

  - question: How does poison ivy cause a rash?
    answer: |
      Poison ivy releases urushiol oil when its leaves or stems are damaged. When this oil comes into contact with

      A poison ivy rash can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the severity of the
