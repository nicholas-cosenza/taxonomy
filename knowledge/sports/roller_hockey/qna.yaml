      Roller in-line hockey is a variant of hockey played on a hard, smooth surface with players using inline skates to
      move and ice hockey sticks to shoot a hard, plastic puck into their opponent's goal to score points. The sport
      is a very fast-paced and free-flowing game and is considered a contact sport, but body checking is prohibited.
      There are five players including the goalkeeper from each team on the rink at a time while teams normally consist
      of 16 players. There are professional leagues, one of which is the National Roller Hockey League (NRHL). While it
      is not a contact sport, there are exceptions, i.e. the NRHL involves fighting.
    question: What is roller in-line hockey?
  - answer: |
      Some of the earliest video evidence of the sport is newsreel footage from the Giornale Luce taken in Vienna, AU
      in 1938. The video shows players using inline skates with five metal wheels and a front wheel brake. Each team
      has four skaters plus a netminder. They are using ice hockey sticks, with taped blades, and the goals closely
      resemble ice hockey goals of the wire-mesh type common in Europe around that time. The game is being played with
      a ball on a rectangular outdoor court, which appears to be asphalt.

      Yes, there is a proffessional in-line hockey league. The National Roller Hockey League is a professional league,
      founded in 2014. The NRHL began its inaugural season 20 February 2015. The NRHL games consist of 3 15-minute
      periods, with 10 minute intermissions. It differs from professional ice hockey with rules including no offsides,
      and no icing. The NRHL permits fighting, with a 5-minute major penalty assessed to the combatants.

      For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play with one less skater
      for a short amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a
      double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration. A single Minor penalty may be extended
      by a further two minutes for drawing blood from the victimized player.
    question: What happens to players who get penalties?
  - answer: There are five players including the goalkeeper from each team on the rink at a time.
    question: How many players are on the ice at one time?
  - answer: The recommended size of the rink can vary between 40m and 60m in length and 20m and 30m in width.
    question: What is the size of the rink?
  - answer: |
      While converted roller rinks may use wooden floors, dedicated inline hockey facilities use Sport Court or
      similar surface, which allows maximum traction to inline hockey wheels whilst providing a smooth, unbroken
      gliding surface for the puck.
    question: Can you describe the playing surface?
  - answer: |
      Inline hockey is typically played at room temperature on a surface that, rather than being made from
      (frozen) water, is kept dry to protect the bearings in the skate wheels.  Inline hockey uses less
      physical contact in comparison to ice hockey.
    question: What are some differences between roller hockey and ice hockey?
  - answer: |
      A professional game consists of two halves of twenty minutes each.
    question: How many periods are in a game?
  - answer: |
      Inline hockey is typically played at room temperature on a surface that, rather than being made from (frozen)
      water, is kept dry to protect the bearings in the skate wheels. Several surface materials are used, including
      plastic tiles (sometimes known as sport-court flooring), wood, and sealed concrete; in general, surfaces try to
      balance the ability of wheels to grip against the ability of the puck to slide freely. None of these surfaces,
      however, is as smooth as ice; as a result, the puck is made of a much lighter plastic material, and rests on
      small nylon or poly-plastic nubs to reduce friction with the rink surface.
    question: What are the main differences from ice hockey?
  - answer: |
      Protective gear is highly recommended and is enforced in all competitive situations. This usually includes a
      helmet (cage worn if certain age), elbow pads, protective gloves, athletic cup, shin pads, and skates at the
      very least. In addition, goaltenders use different gear, (optionally) a neck guard, chest/arm protector,
      blocker, catch glove, and leg pads.
    question: What kind of gear is used in Inline Hockey?
  - answer: |
      The recommended size of the rink can vary between 40m and 60m in length and 20m and 30m in width. In Germany
      the old standard was 40m x 20m which changed to 50m x 25m but also the ice hockey standard of
      61m x 30.5m (200Ã—100 ft) is used.
