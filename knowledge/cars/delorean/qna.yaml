  Answer questions about the DMC DeLorean sports car
seed_examples:
- answer: Yes, there is only 1 of 2 prototypes still in existence. The remaining
    existing prototype has been restored and is displayed at the AACA Museum in
    Hershey, Pennsylvania. The 2nd prototype was sent to Lotus Cars for development
    and evaluation and has been reported destroyed.
  question: Are there any Delorean prototypes still in existence?
- answer: DeLoreans, early-production models in particular, suffered from poor
    build quality as well as mechanical issues. Early-production cars needed as
    much as 200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being
    shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers
    to the quality centers in the US to learn about the problems and how to fix
    them. Quality did improve over time, and by 1982 many of the quality issues
    had been resolved. A total of four recalls were issued by the factory
    to correct problems such as a sticking throttle, front-suspension issues and
    an inertia switch.

    60 miles per hour (0\u201397 km/h) in 8.8 seconds when equipped with a manual\
    \ transmission, but other sources indicate an acceleration time of 9.5 seconds.\
    \ When equipped with a manual transmission, the DeLorean accelerated from\
    \ 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 km/h) in 10.5 seconds as tested by Road\
    \ & Track magazine. Top speed was claimed at 130 mph (209 km/h), but was tested\
