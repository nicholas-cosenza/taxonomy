  - answer: |
      Speed limits on road traffic, as used in most countries, set the legal maximum speed at which vehicles may
      travel on a given stretch of road.  The maximum speed limit on rural two-lane roads ranges from 50 mph in parts
      of the northeast to 75 mph (120 km/h) in parts of Texas. On rural Interstate Highways and other freeways, the
      speed limit ranges from 60 mph (96 km/h) in Hawaii to 85 mph (136 km/h) in parts of Texas. All roads in the
      United States have a speed limit, but it is not always posted (especially in rural areas).
    question: What is a speed limit?
  - answer: |
      Overtaking, usually called "passing", is legal on all four or more lane roads and on most two-lane roads with
      sufficient sight distance. On two-lane roads, one must pass to the left of the overtaken vehicle unless that
      vehicle is preparing to make a left turn, in which case the vehicle must be passed on the right. Passing on
      the left means that the overtaking vehicle must enter the oncoming lane. This should only be done in a legal
      passing zone, designated by either a dashed yellow center-line (indicating that passing is legal in both
      directions) or a solid line paired with a dashed line (indicating that passing is only legal for traffic
      adjacent to the broken line). A solid double yellow line indicated that passing is illegal in both directions.
