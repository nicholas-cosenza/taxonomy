- answer: A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi.
  question: What are Mitochondria?
- answer: They were discovered by Albert von KÃ¶lliker in 1857
  question: Who discovered Mitochondria?
- answer: Some cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells).
  question: Do all cells have mitochondria?
- answer: |
    Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine
    triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy.
  question: What are the physical characteristics
- answer: |
    The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the "powerhouse of the cell", a phrase coined by Philip
    Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.
  question: What is a good way to describe what mitochondria do?
- answer: |
    Although most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has
    its own genome ("mitogenome") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes.
  question: Does mtochondria share the host cell's DNA?
- answer: |
    A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi.
  question: whats the mitochondria
- answer: |
    A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi.
  question: whats the mitochondria in more details
- answer: |
    A mitochondrion contains outer and inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers and proteins.
  question: What kind of shapes does mitocondria have
- answer: |
    The mitochondrial intermembrane space is the space between the outer membrane and the inner membrane.
  question: What is Intermembrane space?
