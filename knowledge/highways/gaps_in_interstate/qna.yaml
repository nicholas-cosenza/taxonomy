      Interstate 70 is one-lane only in these following locations:
      Interstate 70 in Kansas has only one lane for eastbound through traffic for several hundred
      feet in Kansas City where the highway approaches the Lewis and Clark Viaduct Bridge, which
      carries the highway over the Kansas River toward Kansas City, Missouri. Interstate 670, just a few blocks
      south provides an alternate route without this bottleneck.
      Interstate 70 in West Virginia has only one lane for approximately one thousand feet in Wheeling,
      where the highway enters the Wheeling Tunnel and crosses the Ohio River on the Fort Henry Bridge.

      The true gaps are where multiple disjoint sections of road have the same
      Interstate highway number and can reasonably be considered part of
      one-highway in theory, based on the directness of connections via
      other highways, or based on future plans to fill in the gap in the Interstate,
      or simply based on the shortness of the gap
    question: What are true gaps in interstate highways?

    question: What do they call the to convert inner lanes from one direction to the other
  - answer: |
      A true gap is part of a numbered highway that is not physically continuous. They might be
      Connected by another number road in between.
    question: What are true gaps?
  - answer: Yes it does
