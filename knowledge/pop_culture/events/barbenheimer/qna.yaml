      Both films exceeded box-office expectations. Barbie became the
      highest-grossing domestic release in Warner Bros history, surpassing
      Nolan's The Dark Knight. In the United States and Canada, Barbie grossed
      $22.3 million in Thursday night previews, while Oppenheimer grossed $10.5
      million. This was the first time two movies released in the same weekend
      have grossed more than $10 million each in their previews. Including
      previews, the films made $70.5 million and $33 million on their first
      days, respectively, which led to weekend projections being increased to
      $160 million and $77 million. The films went on to debut to $162 million
      and $82.4 million, respectively.

      Barbenheimer was a cultural phenomenon which preceded and surrounded the
      simultaneous theatrical release of two films, Warner Bros. Pictures'
      Barbie and Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023. The strong
      contrast between Barbie—a fantasy comedy by Greta Gerwig about the fashion
      doll Barbie—and Oppenheimer—an epic biographical thriller by Christopher
      Nolan about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the
      Manhattan Project—prompted a comedic response from Internet users,
      including memes, merchandise and memorabilia. Polygon described the two
      films as "extreme opposites", and Variety called the phenomenon "the movie
      event of the year".

      The Barbenheimer phenomenon is an instance of counterprogramming, a
      marketing strategy in which a tonally different film is released on the
      same day as a major film to appeal to an underrepresented group. Universal
      successfully deployed counterprogramming as early as 2002, when it opened
      the dramedy About a Boy opposite the science-fiction blockbuster Star
      Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. The former enjoyed the strongest
      opening for a British film that year, finishing with over $130 million.
