  - answer: |
      It is commonly assumed that black rhinos have poor eyesight, relying more on hearing and smell. However,
      studies have shown that their eyesight is comparatively good, at about the level of a rabbit. Their ears have
      a relatively wide rotational range to detect sounds. An excellent sense of smell alerts rhinos to the
      presence of predators.
