  - question: What are some of the scientific classifications of the Zebu?
    answer: |
      The zebu has the scientific name of the Bos taurus indicus or Bos indicus. Scientific classification of the Zebu
      has it in the Eukaryota domain, of the Animalia Kingdom. The phylum classification of the Chordata under the
      class of animal called Mammalia. The order this animal belongs in is the Artiodactyla. The family/subfamily is
      the Bovinae under the Box genus. The species scientific name is the Bos Taurus.
  - question: When was the Zebu first domesticated?
    answer: |
      Zebu cattle were found to derive from the Indian form of aurochs and have first been domesticated
      between 7,000 and 6,000 YBP at Mehrgarh, present-day Pakistan, by people linked to or coming from Mesopotamia.
  - question: What kind of enviroments did the Zebu adapt?
    answer: |
      Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot savanna and steppe environments. These
      adaptations result in higher tolerance for drought, heat and sunlight exposure. Unlike many Sanga cattle
      however, zebu does not exhibit trypanotolerance, making it susceptible to nagana, as evidenced by the
      pattern of zebu introgression into African cattle.
  - question: How does the Zeby reproduce?
    answer: |
      Zebu are generally mature enough to give birth when they are 29 months old. This is based on the development
      of their bodies to withstand the strain of carrying the calf and lactation. Early reproduction can place too
      much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. The gestation period averages 285 days, but varies
      depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the carrying time, as
      male calves are carried for a longer period than females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the
      overall health of the animal and in return may also affect the gestation period.
  - question: What are some uses for the Zebu?
    answer: |
      Zebu are used as draught and riding animals, beef cattle, dairy cattle, as well as for byproducts such as hides,
      dung for fuel and manure, and horn for knife handles and the like. Zebu, mostly miniature zebu, are kept as
      pets. In India, the number of draft cattle in 1998 was estimated at 65.7 million head. Zebu cows commonly have
      low production of milk. They do not produce milk until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much.
      When zebus are crossed with taurine cattle, milk production generally increases.
