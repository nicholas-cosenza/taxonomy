- answer: | a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) developed for NASA space missions[1] such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Energy's Office of Space and Defense Power Systems within the Office of Nuclear Energy
  question: What is the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator
- answer: | Space exploration missions require safe, reliable, long-lived power systems to provide electricity and heat to spacecraft and their science instruments.
  question: What do Space exploration missions and instruments require ?
- answer: | Solid-state thermoelectric couples convert the heat produced by the natural decay of the radioisotope plutonium-238 to electricity.
  question: What do solid-state thermoelectric couples use to convert heat?
- answer: | The MMRTG is powered by eight Pu-238 dioxide general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules, provided by the US Department of Energy (DOE). Initially, these eight GPHS modules generate about 2 kW thermal power.
  question: What is the MMRTG is powered by ?
- answer: | Curiosity, the MSL rover that was successfully landed in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012, uses one MMRTG to supply heat and electricity for its components and science instruments.
  question: What MSL rover uses MMRTG
